# DMOJ Progress Tracker

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to use

Familiarity with [DMOJ Modern Online Judge](https://dmoj.ca) is required.

`npm start`: Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

From there, you can add any DMOJ users and problems to track their statuses. Note that to add users, you must enter their username, and to add problems, you must enter exactly their **problem code**, not the problem title (e.g. to add [this problem](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc16s1), you must enter the problem code `ccc16s1`, not its name `CCC '16 S1 - Ragaman`)
